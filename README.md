# Appointment-Management-Service

Welcome to our Appointment-Management-Service! This is a team Project for our team DLJL. Our members are Ziyue Jin, Ken Deng, Jiacheng Liu, Yang Li.

## Appointment-Management-App

We also design a client application which use our service: Doctor Appointment Management App. It is designed to help doctors efficiently manage appointments with their patients. The app provides robust features for scheduling, managing availability, retrieving patient and provider data, and managing recurring events. It streamlines administrative tasks, allowing doctors to focus on patient care.
To see detailed documentation of our app, go to https://github.com/FELIX75791/appointment-management-app 

## Building and Running a Local Instance

In order to build and use our service, you must install the following dependencies:

1. **Maven 3.9.5**: Download Maven: (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions. Be sure to set the `bin` path as described in Maven's README. You are recommended to add the path in the source file of bash or zsh.
   
2. **JDK 17**: This project is developed with JDK 17. You can download JDK 17: (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) from Oracle's website and install it.

3. **MyBatis**: Our project uses MyBatis framework. If needed, refer to the official MyBatis Documentation: (https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/).

4. **MySQL**: Install and set up MySQL. For local development, we recommend MySQL Workbench for easier management. Create a database locally and ensure the connection details are properly set up in the projectâ€™s configuration file : application.properties.

5. **Cloning the Project**: you can clone the repository from GitHub. Click the green "Code" button on the repository page, copy the HTTP/SSH link, and use it to clone the project locally. You can also use Github Desktop!

6. **Building the Project**: Once cloned, use Maven to build the project by running: <code>mvn clean install</code> 

7. **Running the Project**: Once built, you can run this project by <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code> 

8. **Getting Code Coverage Report** : You can check code coverage report by running <code>mvn jacoco:report</code>

## Running test
We provided unit tests and integration tests under the directory src/test
You are welcome to test our end points after running an instance. We recommend using Postman or Bruno

## Integration Test
We provided integration test for our latest finalized service in our src/test directory. In the integration test, we firstly test our feature of getting appointments with a date range. We also created a recurring blocks for one provider. On top of it, we check the available time intervals after the creation of recurring blocks. We then test the feature of getting appointment history to correspond to what we create so far. we later test the situatuon of cancellation after we deleted an appointment. Finally, we test our core function of conflict management during appointment creation and our feature of updating an appointment.
In the integration test, we succssfully test our api endpoint and  our class functions with a database we mocked for testing.

## Running a Cloud Based Instance
We have deployed a cloud instance of our service on Google Cloud Platform. To access our service on cloud, go to https://coms4156-436119.ue.r.appspot.com 

## Running test
We provided unit tests under the directory src/test. You can also test by running <code>mvn clean test</code>

## Code Coverage Report

The project uses [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/) (Java Code Coverage Library) to measure the code coverage of our unit tests. JaCoCo is integrated with our build process, and it automatically generates reports detailing the coverage of the codebase, including the percentage of lines and branches covered by the tests.

After running the tests, JaCoCo produces a detailed report in formats like HTML, XML, and CSV that can be viewed for an in-depth analysis of the coverage.

To generate the report, run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

## Style Checking Report

We used the tool **Checkstyle** to check the style of our code and ensure it adheres to industry-standard best practices. Checkstyle helps us maintain code consistency and ensures that our codebase follows the rules defined by the **Google Java Style Guide**.
### Tool Used:
- **Checkstyle**: A development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. We use the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to integrate Checkstyle into our build process.

### Configuration:
- We used the **Google Java Style** for our Checkstyle setup.
- Both source and test directories are included in the style checks.

### Running Style Checks:
To run the Checkstyle checks locally and generate a report, use the following Maven command:
```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

## Static Analysis

We used the tool **PMD** to as the static checker to find potential bugs and bad practices. We used the default ruleset from PMD.
